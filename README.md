## What is Wonderfund?
Wonderfund is a platform that connects non-profits to everyday users in order to raise money. Users contribute in two ways: first, by purchasing prizes on behalf of a non-profit -- once a prize has been purchased, the non-profit organization can then begin a raffle for that prize. Once a raffle is active, users can then contribute in the second way by purchasing tickets to enter the raffle and a chance to win the designated prize. When the raffle reaches its end time and closes, a winning ticket is drawn: whichever user pruchased that ticket wins the prize while the non-profit organization gets to keep the money raised.

### Check out the site for yourself at: [wonderfundgroup.com](http://www.wonderfundgroup.com/)
Make sure to use the 'Login' option in the upper-right to sign in with a Google Account. Once you're logged in, explore the active raffles, view our non-profit pages, and try buying some tickets through the checkout system.

(Note: the payment system is setup with PayPal Sandbox, so no actual payment information is processed and it's advised that you use dummy payment data when "buying" tickets).

### Wonderfund is built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Other technologies used include Moment.js, Mongoose, Google OAuth, PayPal Sandbox, and Material UI.

###### *Disclaimer*: this is a student project and is not in any way affiliated with any of the non-profit organziations listed on the website. Likewise, none of the raffles on the website are real, and no money or prizes are exchanging hands.
